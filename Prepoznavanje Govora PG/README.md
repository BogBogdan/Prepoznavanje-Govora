This project focuses on developing a speech recognition system that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to track spoken words and, based on their identification, generates visual representations of corresponding objects such as circles, squares, cubes, and more. By leveraging CNN's capabilities, the system accurately identifies spoken words and maps them to specific objects in real-time. This innovative approach not only enhances speech recognition accuracy but also provides a visual context, enabling users to interact with the system intuitively.

Key Features:

Speech Recognition: Implemented a robust speech recognition module capable of accurately identifying spoken words in various languages and dialects.
Object Visualization: Utilized CNN to map recognized words to corresponding objects, generating visual representations such as circles, squares, and cubes.
Real-time Processing: Designed the system for real-time processing, enabling instantaneous recognition and visualization of spoken words and objects.
User Interaction: Enhanced user experience by providing intuitive visual feedback, allowing users to interact with the system seamlessly.
